# Among Us Auto Tasker - ðŸ¤–ðŸ”§
### Have you ever felt like the tasks in Among Us were just too tedious?
Well fret no more, as the **Among Us Auto Tasker** (AUAT - pronouced oat) is here to help!

**AUAT** can complete every single task in Among Us (except for emergency tasks) quickly, efficiently, and (almost) never breaks. It does ***not*** inject code into Among Us and does ***not*** modifiy any game files. Instead, it analyzes what is on your screen and moves your mouse appropriately in order to complete the tasks. It works on all three maps, and handles errors internally, so it won\'t crash on you in the middle of a game.

Never again do such annoying tasks as Simon Says ([Start Reactor](https://among-us.fandom.com/wiki/Start_Reactor "Start Reactor")), Vending Machine ([Buy Beverage](https://among-us.fandom.com/wiki/Buy_Beverage "Buy Beverage")), Clean Leaves ([Clean O2 Filter](https://among-us.fandom.com/wiki/Clean_O2_Filter "Clean O2 Filter")), or even Wiring ([Fix Wiring](https://among-us.fandom.com/wiki/Fix_Wiring "Fix Wiring"))!
